# The future of electricity 

## how to run the application: 
clone down using git clone 'url', run 'npm install' and then run 'yarn dev'. 

## Design, kindly provided by Håkon Lavik
some design ideas sketched out by Håkon in XD after some discussion. 
We decided to avoid the color green due to its connection with the environmental movement, and as this application does not show which electricity provider that provides the most environmental-friendly power it is better to not have the brand in a green color to avoid "green washing".
