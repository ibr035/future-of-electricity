# The future of electricity 

## how to run the application: 
clone down using git clone `https://github.com/ibr035/future-of-electricity.git`, run`npm install` and then run `yarn dev`. 

## Design
I decided to avoid the color green due to its connection with the environmental movement, and as this application does not show which electricity provider that provides the most environmental-friendly power it is better to not have the brand in a green color to avoid "green washing". 


## future implementation: 
- Create filtering function on providers based on consumption of the user. 
  - Make it possible for the user to write their annual kwh usage and based on that give a recommendation on which would be cheapest and somehow include the hourly cost. 
- create a more elaborate design theme with mobile phone design an design for the different pages.
- create a template for articles posts 
- host system
- fix both datasets to connect to api instead of json data 
- cookie GDPR setup 
- setup a CMS 
- Could be interesting to somehow connect it to ChatGpt to manage some of the explanations (mainly because it would be fun to try and implement)
